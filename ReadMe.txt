Hello reader,
This is small mini project developed by Shubham Singh Student of Ramrao Adik Insitute of Technology, Nerul.
Here it focuses on 3 main task of any Banking system
1. Registering new users with the bank
2. Adding money to there Account
3. Withdrawal of money from the Account

It is a small mini project developed using python tkinter.
The database is stored in sqlite3 which is a package that comes along with python.
The only requirement for this is python software (for more convenience keep the advanced one).
The first page to be executed is home.py
Just open home.py and register yourself clicking on signup command.

Rest part of the project is to simple to use.

Thank You.
